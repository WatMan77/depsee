# How to use the app?

## Navigation

You can move between Registration, Login and Home pages using the Menu bar at the top of every page. The Menu bar also contains a Logout button which logs the user out and redirects to the Login page.

## Registering

You may create an account at the registration page by entering your email, username and a password.

**NOTE** The username is unique and not case sensitive.

## Logging in and out

After creating a user account, you may log in on the Login page with your username and password. You may also use your email instead of your username. When logged in, a Logout button will appear in the Menu bar. To log out, click the Logout button.

**NOTE** The next steps require the user to be logged in.
